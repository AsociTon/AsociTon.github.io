reading purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So baboon this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
impassive fruitlessly shut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

&lt;h4&gt;Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon&lt;/h4&gt;

I am doing it, I guess I will be maintaining a number of small posts/pages on a monthly/weekly basis,
the pages will contain summary of what I did, something I came across, my interests ( precisely speaking highlights for that duration! ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about writing some stuff, mostly for my future self! well I could write a
diary instead, but I am too clumsy to maintain a diary and the blogs are more convinient for me ( after all I can embed pictures, videos, links…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pages will comprise of my personal takes on things I wanted to say, english is not my first language so please bear with it! It will be like my own social media where I post stuff, I will try to avoid boring stuff :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BTW scrapbook by definition is a colorful book with pictures and texts depicting cool and precious experiences of one’s life on a personal level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am Abhishek Kumar Singh!

&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on my scrapbook! How exciting! I’m sure I’ll put a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way when relaxing, I spend my time either watching anime, listening to music, reading manga! I have watched so many series but personally I believe
&lt;strong&gt;One Piece&lt;/strong&gt; is G.O.A.T!
I get a lot of inspiration from the ideas of the anime world. The strong emotions and
bonds! I can talk about it for endless time :D, I guess I will mention a lot of anime related stuff in my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here are some more &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/featured/530/25_Memorable_One_Piece_Quotes&quot;&gt;Memorable One Piece Quotes&lt;/a&gt; from myanimelist.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Haxplore Arc]]></title><description><![CDATA[My journey to Haxplore 2019 was by far the most distant place I travelled to for

attending a hackathon, it was a hackathon by IIT BHU afterall + we got
travel reimbursements! ( thanks to them for taking care of our accomodation too ),
it was their first time organizing a hackathon! still we had high hopes from this hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team of three departed from Ghaziabad, India to travel around 800 Kms to reach Varanasi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insight: Varanasi or Benaras is the oldest living city of the world and is the city of our
lord Shiva, you must have heard the chants of Om, yeah that’s his signature!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also varanasi is the neighbouring city to my hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey was a 14hrs journey via train and it went quite well! we had planned on deciding what to make
in the hackathon during this duration but the window seat took it all away! initially we had a little bit
discussion on certain ideas but then we put on earphones turned the music on and kneeled our heads on the
window looking at the view outside. It was peaceful. We fell asleep …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning our train was right on time ( for Indian railway it’s a big thing ) and we reached our destination,
the station was the most beautiful station of Indian railways that I ever came across! we got some snacks and booked
a cab to BHU.( I could tell a lot though! incident at the snack shop, incident with OLA but I will keep this part short )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHU or Benaras Hindu University is like a city in itself, you have to take e-rickshaw to travel from one department to another,
that is the size of this university. It was my first time seeing this huge university, anyway I already had an idea of what to expect! our venue was Malviya
block where we had to do some paperwork on the registration booth for identification and later, on completion were provided
with our haxplore ID cards and some CODEFEST goodies.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were guided to our accomodation, after taking a short break we left to explore the city in the eve :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eve we started by roaming around BHU, we ate bati chokha ( it’s one of the best dishes of that side which I was longing for! ) and We visited assi ghat, it was flooding at that time, so water was near to the top stairs, we couldn’t go for boating :(
instead we went with a masala tea! and watching the holy river Ganga flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we were ready for the hackathon, at night we finally concluded on
what to build and then went to sleep since the next day was going to be hectic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

Wow! I am doing it, I guess I will be maintaining a number of pages on a monthly/weekly basis,
the pages will contain summary of what I did, something I came across, my interests ( precisely speaking highlights for that duration! ).

I have been thinking about writing some stuff, mostly for my future self! well I could write a 
diary instead, but I am too clumsy to maintain a diary and blog seems more convinient to me ( after all I can embed pictures, videos, links...)

The pages will comprise of my personal take on things,  english is not my first language so please bear with it, I will try to avoid boring stuff :)

**BTW scrapbook by definition is a colorful book with pictures and texts depicting cool and precious experiences of one's life on a personal level.**

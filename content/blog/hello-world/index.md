I am Abhishek Kumar Singh!

This is my first post on my scrapbook! How exciting! I'm sure I'll put a lot more interesting things in the future.

By the way when relaxing, I spend my time either watching anime, listening to music, reading manga or simply staring at my surroundings! I have watched so many series but personally I believe 
**One Piece** is G.O.A.T! 
I get a lot of inspiration from the ideas of the anime world. The strong emotions and
 bonds! I can talk about it for endless time :D, I guess I will keep mentioning anime related stuff in my coming posts.

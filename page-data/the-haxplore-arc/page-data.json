( thanks to them for taking care of our accomodation too ),\nit was their first time organizing a hackathon! and we had high hopes from this hackathon.</p>\n<p>Our team of three departed from Ghaziabad, India to travel around 800 Kms to reach Varanasi.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight: Varanasi or Benaras is the oldest living city of the world and is the city of our\nlord Shiva, you must have heard the chants of Om, yeah that’s his signature!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Varanasi is the neighbouring city to my hometown.</p>\n<p>Our journey was a 14hrs journey via train and it went quite well! we had planned on deciding what to make\nin the hackathon during this duration but the window seat took it all away! initially we had a little\ndiscussion on certain ideas but then we put on our earphones turned the music on and kneeled our heads on the\nwindow looking at the view outside. It was peaceful, we spent our time talking before we fell asleep …</p>\n<p>The next morning our train was right on time ( for Indian railway it’s a big thing ) and we reached our destination,\nthe station was the most beautiful station of Indian railways that I ever came across! we got some snacks and booked\na cab to BHU.( I could mention a lot here like incident at the snack shop, incident with OLA but I will keep this part short )</p>\n<p>BHU or Benaras Hindu University is like a city in itself, you have to take e-rickshaw to travel from one department to another,\nthat is the size of this university. It was my first time seeing this huge university, anyway I already had an idea of what to expect! our venue was Malviya\nblock where we had to do some paperwork on the registration booth for identification and later after completion, we were provided\nwith our haxplore ID cards and some CODEFEST goodies.\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/47311/haxplore-id-card.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUDBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGvLocDVsE5YBXYGf/EABwQAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDAAIEERIiMv/aAAgBAQABBQJ51St3cplHpb1GLDAMZYM//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQMBAT8BCDP/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIP/aAAgBAgEBPwFj/8QAHhAAAQMEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACEQMQITEiQWH/2gAIAQEABj8C3CbLzE2HpVPkDnq0OQ3i3//EABsQAQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACEQMUFx/9oACAEBAAE/IU0N+I5cImfd8QKEE35ldHCTgHpBusRDuvfH/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABA7z3z/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBEh/9oACAEDAQE/ENogcZ//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBH/2gAIAQIBAT8QMGRn/8QAHRABAQABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhABAxQWGRwf/aAAgBAQABPxAVdLEMgszzZqqAVZgg2pyoHoi0841bHFchk59bFWoFTMn3WcIAvcabf//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"haxplore id card\"\n        title=\"haxplore id card\"\n        src=\"/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/1c72d/haxplore-id-card.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/a80bd/haxplore-id-card.jpg 148w,\n/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/1c91a/haxplore-id-card.jpg 295w,\n/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/1c72d/haxplore-id-card.jpg 590w,\n/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/a8a14/haxplore-id-card.jpg 885w,\n/static/5d9a64fac12f6f8851b818b119ff4b46/47311/haxplore-id-card.jpg 1080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>We were guided to our accomodation, after taking a short break we left to explore the city in the eve :D</p>\n<p>In the eve we started by roaming around BHU, we ate bati chokha ( it’s one of the best dishes of my side which I was longing for! ) then we took an auto to visit assi ghat, it was flooded at that time, water was near to the top stairs, we couldn’t go for boating :(\ninstead we went for sipping masala tea! and watching the holy river Ganga flow.</p>\n<p>At night we finally concluded on what to build and then went to sleep since the next day was going to be hectic.
